      <description>Bundles is a new feature coming to the ruleguard. It&amp;rsquo;ll make it possible to re-use third-party rules without having to copy/paste them.
Creating an importable bundle A package that exports rules must define a Bundle object:
package gorules import &amp;quot;github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard/dsl&amp;quot; // Bundle holds the rules package metadata. // // In order to be importable from other gorules package, // a package must define a Bundle variable. var Bundle = dsl.</description>

 Intro As long as your assembler code does something simple, you&amp;rsquo;re golden.
As soon as you&amp;rsquo;ll need to call a Go function from it, the first suggestion that you&amp;rsquo;ll probably get: don&amp;rsquo;t do it. Perhaps you would like to follow that advice, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re unsure why you needed it in the first place.</description>

 gogrep is one of my favorite tools. It gives you the ability to search Go code using syntax patterns, filter matches by expression types, and perform structural replace.
Today I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about how to use gogrep and about VS Code extension that integrates gogrep into the editor.</description>

 Recursive descent parsing works well when you can continue parsing using the current context and a given token.
Some expressions make parsing harder: postfix, infix and other. They introduce a problem: you don&amp;rsquo;t know which kind of expression you&amp;rsquo;re processing until you&amp;rsquo;ve already parsed half of it.</description>

      <title>ruleguard: dynamic inspection rules for Go</title>

 This article introduces a new static analysis library (and CLI utility) go-ruleguard. It&amp;rsquo;s like a gogrep that is adapted for the use inside your CI pipeline.
You describe static analysis rules in terms of a special Go-like DSL. During the startup, ruleguard turns these definitions into a set of inspections to be executed.</description>

      <title>Step driven evaluation</title>
      <link>https://quasilyte.dev/blog/post/step-pattern/</link>

      <description>If you heard about table driven tests, the idea described in this article will be easier to grasp, since it&amp;rsquo;s the same technique, but used outside of the tests.
Suppose you have a function that executes a lot of other functions. This function probably does two main things:
 It checks for all returned errors as they occur. It passes one function outputs as the inputs for another.  // process is an example pipeline-like function.</description>

      <title>log.Fatal vs log.Panic</title>
      <link>https://quasilyte.dev/blog/post/log-fatal-vs-log-panic/</link>

      <guid>https://quasilyte.dev/blog/post/log-fatal-vs-log-panic/</guid>
      <description>Update: probably the best alternative to log.Fatalf inside main is log.Printf followed by a return statement. If your main function contains a lot of such exit points, consider using a step driven evaluation pattern.
 I personally don&amp;rsquo;t like log.Fatal/Fatalf/Fatalln. I feel sad because of their ubiquity in Go examples as a form of reaction to an error. I personally prefer log.Panic.
The log.Panic vs log.Fatal is essentially panic vs os.</description>

      <title>Go compiler: SSA optimization rules description language</title>

      <description>Original (ru): https://habr.com/post/415771/.
 Go compiler uses its own Lisp-like domain-specific language (DSL) for Static Single Assignment (SSA) optimization rules description.
Lets dig into that language, its peculiarities and limitations. As an excercise, we&amp;rsquo;ll add a new optimization rule into Go compiler that would optimize expressions like a*b+c using new operations we&amp;rsquo;re going to implement along the way.
This is the first article in the series about Go compiler SSA backend, this is why I&amp;rsquo;ve included some fundamental and architectural info besides DSL overview.</description>

      <title>Go AVX-512 support</title>
      <link>https://quasilyte.dev/blog/post/go-avx512/</link>

      <description>About this document This article is going to be up-to-date source of AVX-512 information in Go context.
It references other posts, official documentation and other useful resources.
It&amp;rsquo;s short. By purpose.
Only English content is referenced (original + translated).
Documentation  AVX-512 support in Go assembler: short reference that focuses on Go-specific implementation of AVX-512. It describes how to use all AVX-512 special features in Go assembly syntax as well as some encoder details.</description>

      <title>Disassembling Go AVX-512</title>
      <link>https://quasilyte.dev/blog/post/disassembling-go-avx512/</link>

      <guid>https://quasilyte.dev/blog/post/disassembling-go-avx512/</guid>
      <description>The problem Go 1.11 got updated assembler that supports AVX-512, but disassembler is left unchanged.
In other words, go tool asm speaks AVX-512, go tool objdump does not.
Suppose we have this avx.s file:
TEXT ·avxCheck(SB), 0, $0 VPOR X0, X1, X2 //; AVX1 VPOR Y0, Y1, Y2 //; AVX2 VPORD.BCST (DX), Z1, K2, Z2 //; AVX-512 RET  You will be surprised after assemble+disassemble attempt:
$ go tool asm avx.</description>

      <title>Dispatch tables in Go asm</title>
      <link>https://quasilyte.dev/blog/post/go-asm-dispatch-tables/</link>

      <description>Dispatch tables When you want to execute particular code path depending on some kind of tag/opcode or other integer value that can be easily mapped into index, dispatch tables can speed things up compared to the sequence of comparisons and conditional jumps.
In interpreters, this technique is often used as an alternative to switch-based dispatch.
It&amp;rsquo;s called direct threading in that domain. Each opcode corresponds to table index that contains machine code address that can execute operation specified by the opcode.</description>

      <title>Goism objects layout model</title>

      <description>Introduction Goism project requires Go pointers emulation inside Emacs Lisp code.
This document describes how to achive (almost) full functionality with potential to have optimizations that eliminate some of the emulation-related overhead.
The actual implementation can diverge. Only initial design is outlined.
Struct representation Go structures represented by lists.
Empty struct run-time value is unspecified, but it satisfies Go spec requirements.
type a1 struct { f1 int } // a1{1} // (list 1) type a2 struct { f1, f2, f3, f4 int } // a2{1, 2, 3, 4} // (list 1 2 3 4)  For the very small (1-3 fields) objects lists are a better choice than vectors, but generally, vectors are more memory-efficient and provide faster random access.</description>

      <description>Third flavour of x86 assembly language This article is heavily inspired by AT&amp;amp;T VS Intel/Microsoft assembly syntax comparison page. It helped me very much in the past.
Many tools understand both AT&amp;amp;T and Intel style assembly. Go derived Plan9 toolchain, so you should learn third kind of assembly language. It will not accept anything else.
In this document:
 Comparison of Plan9/Go and AT&amp;amp;T/GNU assembly; Some non-obvious details that are not described anywhere else; Links to useful resources;  Check external resources for information that is missing here.</description>

      <title>Go nested functions and static locals</title>
      <link>https://quasilyte.dev/blog/post/go-nested-functions-and-static-locals/</link>

      <guid>https://quasilyte.dev/blog/post/go-nested-functions-and-static-locals/</guid>
      <description>Symbol visibility Default symbol visibility should be as narrow as possible. This means that you use globals with internal linkage instead of external, local variables rather than globals, hide class-related constants inside it&amp;rsquo;s scope, and so on.
If function is only called inside particular function, it should become a nested function.
Most of these rely on the language support.
Go has quite simple model of scopes and symbol visibility. User-defined identifier can be local or package-local (global).</description>

      <title>Path to convenient C FFI in Go</title>
      <link>https://quasilyte.dev/blog/post/cgo-funcall/</link>

      <guid>https://quasilyte.dev/blog/post/cgo-funcall/</guid>
      <description>DWIM-style FFI CGo is a widely adopted way of calling C functions from Go: low level C FFI which does many things behind the scene, but exposes only minimal functionality that is required to interact with C.
CGo does no implicit conversions or data copying during C functions call, even int and C.int are not compatible. Code that uses this mechanism without wrappers (bindings) will be polluted with explicit slice/array copies and type conversions.</description>
